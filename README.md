Insights and Recommendations
Pulling it all together

Current Status of the Project
Based on my findings, I have concluded that the newer SME and residential customers are more likely to unsubscribe to the services provided by PowerCo than the old users.

Factors for the high Churn Rate :
1. Bad onboarding experience
Onboarding is the first time the customer is interacting with your product. Make an impact by:
•	Using guided walkthroughs
•	Creating engaging onboarding videos and content
•	Embedding training modules in the product for complex features
•	Mapping the onboarding journey, A/B test and constantly improve

2. Poor Customer Experience & Service
Even though a sale has been made, poor customer experience is one of the leading reasons for customer churn. This can stem from something as simple as bad in-app user experience or poor customer support. 

3. Product Problems
Crashes and downtime impacts the customer experience. A leading payments app would often face crashes in India and saw significant churn when users were unable to use the app during offline purchases. The company responded by acknowledging the problem, focussing teams on solving it and then launching a cashback program to win users back. 
4. Competition
Sometimes the competition comes up with innovations and product features which draws users to its platform. Even though your company has done well in meeting the customer expectations, often competition can beat you in pricing, customer experience, building trust or execution. 

5. Poor Product/Market Fit
he initial hypothesis on user problems and perceived solutions may be wrong. It may be beneficial to start improving on the product and pricing so that the users do not churn.

6. Pricing
We have frequently seen how pricing can impact churn. At times, merely a 5% increase in the pricing can lead to a significant churn. It is important to understand the price elasticity of the customers before deploying a new pricing strategy. Understand price sensitivity by talking to customers or trying out A/B testing with pricing.

Final Insights

1. Hence, a discounting strategy in which customers that have a high propensity to churn: a 20% discount might be effective.

2. Also, based on my churn model that has an accuracy of 87.3% we can predict the potential churns based on the data collected from them.

3.This will help the company to classify the users based on their activity, hence providing a customised pricing options for a specific set of customers/ SME
